# BLOOM

## Venue

- [x] Secure the Social Hive for the weekend

## Judges

No profs this time; people from industry, alums, and other cool people

Moved tracking status of judges to the [issue](https://github.com/compsigh/compsigh/issues/43)

## Extra credit

Continuing from DEPLOY/24, we are asking professors if they'd be willing to provide students who attend BLOOM with extra credit. We'll have an attendance API professors can query with a `student_email`. They'll be able to set the bar at attending opening night, or presenting on day three as a fair middle ground.

## Prizes

We've agreed that the prizes for DEPLOY/24 were good, but we should aim for more useful prizes (e.g. few people made use of the microgrants).

We'll continue with the top-three format + people's choice, as well as a trophy for the first place team.

We'll continue to not offer cash prizes.

First place:

- [compsigh/BLOOM merch](https://github.com/compsigh/compsigh/issues/36)
- Automatic approval for $200 microgrant to work on your project
- Discord Nitro or subscription or membership to an educational or creative software up to $100

Second place:

- Automatic approval for $200 microgrant to work on your project
- Discord Nitro or subscription or membership to an educational or creative software up to $100

Third place:

- Automatic approval for $200 microgrant to work on your project

People's Choice:

- Plushie of Edward's cat

## Trophy

Ideas for trophy:

- Black resin print of sunflower on a black base
- Anodized black aluminium with sunflower extrusion

## Sponsors

E&I is providing us with the remainder of what we didn't spend on DEPLOY/24 from the fund of $3000 — of which we spent $1576.23. If we exceed that amount, they are open to providing more.

## Point system & rubric

For BLOOM, one of our experiments is throwing away the idea of a rubric. Instead, judges will be given a set of things we're looking for and would love to see, and are given full reign to conduct their own vibe checks.

We are also discarding grade-based weighting for the event.

### Basic qualifications

If any of these are lacking in a team's presentation, organizers and/or judges will reach out to the team in question for elaboration. Extenuating circumstances will be evaluated case-by-case, but if a team proves unable to remedy the situation, they are subject to disqualification.

- All teammates' roles and contributions are clearly articulated.
- Where applicable, the project is open-source or is otherwise publicly accessible.

## Food

The plan is to provide food for:

- Opening night, after opening keynote, around 7pm; dinner
- Throughout day two; snacks and such
- Presentation day, before presentations, around 12pm; lunch

Ideas for catering:

- Toast & Egg
- Pineapple King Bakery
- Mr Singh's Curry Pizza

## Keynote

## Merch

We're giving out some merch to attendees, as well as winners. See the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/compsigh/compsigh/issues/36) for details.

## Links

- [BLOOM Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/aEMV4laiF3RSIgap6rEm9N/BLOOM?node-id=0-1&t=YoPXAadOkMRuwyta-1)

## Notes

### Aesthetic direction

- Metal, flowers, Vyse type shit, hard rock, Spring vibes, Far Cry New Dawn type shit
- alternative Spring-like, à la Cuphead, Super Paper Mario pixel world, etc. more cheery

### Poster campaign

- Free yourself from AI slop
- A return to form
- The hackathon for the arts & sciences
  - Dramatically expand the net of people that can attend — basically all students in CAS
- Art/design: Great Wave (+ other famous artworks) bitmapped
- Artwork by Ray (Instagram)

### Trailer

We're not doing one, but here are the notes from brainstorming:

- Hype trailer
  - IRL val champs style cinematic with top teams from DEPLOY/24 "come take the crown" type shit
  - DEMONS OTG trailer music
- Explainer trailer
  - Invite our friends who are doing both CS and something else that's interesting
    - Faadil
    - Sanju
  - People put CS and the work that we do in a box. Not everything has to be an app. Certainly not everything has to be AI. Research papers. Discovering a bug; making an open-source contribution. And what happens when we intersect with humanities? Documentaries. Music. Our potential is a lot greater than we give ourselves credit for.
  - À la MasterClass almost lol
